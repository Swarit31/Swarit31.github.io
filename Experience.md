## Research assistant @ [Micro and Nano Manufacturing Laboratory](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/micro-and-nano-manufacturing-laboratory/research.html), University of Cincinnati      (Aug. 2024 – Dec. 2024; May 2025 - June 2025)
### Design and development of an electrochemical milling process 
  -	A custom system was developed for horizontal electrochemical milling of grade 2 Titanium, tailored to meet specific project requirements.
  -	System was small scale down version of actual industrial equipment, developed with an arduino implemented control system. 
### Study on gas films and sparking in ultrasonic electrochemical discharge machining
  -	Worked in wet lab environment performing ultrasonic vibration-assisted electrochemical discharge machining. Collect high-speed camera machining data of the process.
  - Using machine learning models CNN and MLP accurately predicted the location of sparks and the thickness of the gas film. 
### Simulation of electrochemical machining process 
  -	Develop a full-process simulation suite of a specialized electrochemical manufacturing process for a Defense-related project.
  -	Simulate dynamic material removal rate along with size and shape of cut contours.
