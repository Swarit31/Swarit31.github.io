# Projects

## Photocatalyst assisted electrochemical machining of grade 5 Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V)
  - A custom system was designed and developed based on electrochemical machining system for a research study on photocatalyst assisted hybrid electrochemical machining of Ti-6Al-4V.
  - Modeled the system in CATIA V5 and fabricated a functional prototype using FDM & SLA additive processes. Designed and integrated a control system using Arduino, along with temperature, current, and flow sensors for
    real-time monitoring. Designed supporting sensor circuitry ensuring reliable data acquisition and system functionality. Assembled the full system including all 3D printed components, electronics, and mechanical
    interfaces into a working unit	
  - Successfully machined Ti-6Al-4V using the developed ECM setup. The system performed reliably under experimental conditions, enabling precise control over the machining environment. Demonstrated effective integration
    of mechanical design, electronics, and hands-on prototyping to support advanced materials research.

## Comparing Acoustic Horn Designs for Ultrasonic electro discharge machining [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZvKJ6EA-MULNo2_hepJlK4ximdFGhar/view?usp=sharing)
 - Designed and evaluated ultrasonic horns for Ultrasonic Electro discharge Machining process, where the carbide tool would be attached on the output side of horn for maximum vibrations, focusing on optimal shape and        material selection.
 - Review literature on horn designs and materials used in ultrasonic machining. Designed 2 horn geometries in CATIA V5 based on UEDM requirements and compared three materials using key performance metrics: displacement,
   magnification factor, stress and frequency.
 - Performed analytical calculations and validated results through ANSYS simulations using harmonic modal analysis.Identified the most viable horn geometry and material combination. Provided data-driven design
  recommendations to enhance UEDM efficiency and reliability.
 - Based on the result among materials Titanium and Step geometry were optimum but due to manufacturing constraints Aluminum and Cone geometry preferred which
   were very close in performance. Further 3 cone geometries were studied based on output diameter for holding the tool in UEDM process.
