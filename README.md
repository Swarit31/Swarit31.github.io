# Work Experience 
## Research assistant @ [Micro and Nano Manufacturing Laboratory](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/micro-and-nano-manufacturing-laboratory/research.html), University of Cincinnati      (_Aug 2022 â€“ Exp. Dec 2025_)
### Design and development of an electrochemical milling process 
####  -	A custom system was developed for horizontal electrochemical milling of grade 2 Titanium, tailored to meet specific project requirements.
####  -	System was small scale down version of actual industrial equipment, developed with an arduino implemented control system.
### Study on gas films and sparking in ultrasonic electrochemical discharge machining
####  -	Worked in wet lab environment performing ultrasonic vibration-assisted electrochemical discharge machining. Collect high-speed camera machining data of the process.
####  - Using machine learning models CNN and MLP accurately predicted the location of sparks and the thickness of the gas film.
### Simulation of electrochemical machining process 
####  -	Develop a full-process simulation suite of a specialized electrochemical manufacturing process for a Defense-related project.
####  -	Simulate dynamic material removal rate along with size and shape of cut contours.

## B.E., Mechanical Engineering | Savitribai Phule Pune University (_May 2022_)
- First Class with Distinction
- GPA: 8.73/10.00
- Advisor: [Dr. P.D. Patil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P1Zk7XgAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Undergraduate Thesis:[ Study on mechnical properties of additively manufactured femur bone implant](https://ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT2205752.pdf)
- Developed a patient-specific femur bone implant through structural analysis and design optimization. Conducted a literature review on femur biomechanics and functions. Performed a 3D CT scan to capture accurate bone geometry, created an anatomically accurate, optimized implant design with 2 materials ABS and PLA.
- Evaluated mechanical properties and predicted service life using material benchmarks for additively manufactured implants.Demonstrated structural integrity and feasibility for long-term use, based on which it was found ABS material to perform better than PLA which both in the simulations and actual tests.
