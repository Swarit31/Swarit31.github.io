# Education

## M.S., Mechanical Engineering (Micro and Nano Manufacturing) | University of Cincinnati (_August 2022 - Exp. December 2025_)
- GPA: 3.23/4.0
- Advisor: [Dr. Murali Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXY-oQMAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Awards: GIA Scholarship

### Graduate Thesis: _Photocatalyst Assisted Electrochemical Machining of Titanium_
- Developed a novel Ultraviolet-assisted hybrid electrochemical machining method for titanium. Implemented Control system using Arduino as well as design of experiments executed to achieve enhanced material removal rate, better surface finish and lower overcut.

## B.E., Mechanical Engineering | Savitribai Phule Pune University (_May 2022_)
- First Class with Distinction
- GPA: 8.73/10.00
- Advisor: [Dr. P.D. Patil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P1Zk7XgAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Undergraduate Thesis:[ Study on mechnical properties of additively manufactured femur bone implant](https://ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT2205752.pdf)
- Developed a patient-specific femur bone implant through structural analysis and design optimization. Conducted a literature review on femur biomechanics and functions. Performed a 3D CT scan to capture accurate bone geometry, created an anatomically accurate, optimized implant design with 2 materials ABS and PLA.
- Evaluated mechanical properties and predicted service life using material benchmarks for additively manufactured implants.Demonstrated structural integrity and feasibility for long-term use, based on which it was found ABS material to perform better than PLA which both in the simulations and actual tests.
